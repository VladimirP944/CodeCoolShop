# Codecool shop

## Project Description

Everyone loves to buy and sell stuff, but we need a shop for that! In this
project, the goal is to build one of the [most common type of websites on the
web]: an online eCommerce web-application, where users can browse products, add them into
a shopping cart, then check out and make payments.

## What are you going to learn?

- how to create dynamic web pages in Java with servlets
- how to use the DAO design pattern in Java
- how to use the Thymeleaf templating engine
- how to handle fractional monetary unit appropriately with BigDecimal

## A bit of context

This application was built as part of my CodeCool journey.
I've worked on this app 1 sprint (4 days) with the help of my teammate Dragos Vasile.
When we started working on this project we had about 9 months of programming experience and about 3 months of Object-oriented programming (OOP).

## General requirements

- Advanced OOP concepts, such as inheritance, are used in the project. There is at least one abstract class and one interface implemented.
- The project maintains the three-layer structure of controllers handling HTTP, service objects handling business logic, and DAOs handling data access.
- The page does not show a server error anytime during the review.
- All code is pushed to GitHub repository in atomic commits.

## Features of the project

- On the homepage you can scrooll all the products.
