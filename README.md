# CodeCool Shop

## Project Description

CodeCool Shop is a web based shop.

The application is designed to be used by users to shop around for their favourite electronics.
It was developed with Java and Thymeleaf, which is easy to use and easy to maintain.
Once you open the web page you can see all the products that are listed. You can also filter products by category or manufacturer.
If you register and log in you will be able to demo the purchase stages and will be directed to a dummy payment page.
We also implemented a cart system where you can add products, increase/decrease their quantity and also delete them entirely.


Hope you enjoy using our shop!

## Some of the challenges we meet

- Create an advanced Java project.
- Using Thymeleaf for the frontend.
- Using java servlets for routing.
- Plan the development of an advanced product.

## A bit of context

This application was built as part of my CodeCool journey. \
I've worked on this app for about 8 days with the help of my team-mate Dragos Vasile. \
When we started working on this project we had about 9 months of programming experience and about 3 months of java development. \
We had a lot of fun working on this project and we learned a lot about java development.
